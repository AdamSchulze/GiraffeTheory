// This class stores everything each level has. It's just meant to be a simple way to package all the information together.
// Most importantly: position and number of starting nodes, any edges, and victory conditions.
// Other things can be added later. For example, does this level have directed edges? Where does the squirrel start?

    // Exactly how the onscreen position of the nodes will be represented and stored, I don't know
    // That's why this is an integer tuple intitially, it's subject to change.
    
    // Stores the starting edges as an integer tuple of (start, end, weight)

    // I'm still unclear how to store a general case for victory conditions, but we'll figure it out eventually.
